# Kindred: A Personal Relationship Gardener 

**Kindred** is a minimalist "Personal CRM" designed to help you nurture your real-world connections. In our busy digital lives, it’s easy to forget to check in on the people who matter most until it feels awkward.

Kindred solves this by treating your relationships like a garden. It gives you a clear visual cue when a connection is "wilting" and needs attention, ensuring you never lose touch with friends, family, or mentors.

## How It Works

* **The Garden Concept:** Contacts are visualized as plants.
    * 🟢 **Thriving:** You've contacted them recently.
    * 🟡 **Needs Attention:** It has been a while.
    * 🔴 **Wilting:** You are overdue for a catch-up.
* **Watering Schedules:** You define the frequency for each person (e.g., "Call Mom every 7 days" vs "Call Mentor every 30 days").
* **Smart Sorting:** The app automatically floats the people who need attention most to the top of your list.

## Privacy First

Kindred values your privacy. The app is built using **Local Storage**, meaning all your contact data lives **only on your device**. No data is ever sent to an external server.

## Tech Stack

* **React.js:** Component-based UI and state management.
* **Local Storage:** For persistent data without a backend database.
* **CSS:** Fully mobile-responsive design for on-the-go usage.
